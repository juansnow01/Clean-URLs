# Clean-URLs

Instead of having to always doing it manually, I would like for encrypted chat services like [Signal](https://signal.org/#signal) or like [Session](https://getsession.org/) for include an automatic URL cleaner.

How that gets implemented is not for me to decide but I use an extension on Firefox and Tor called [ClearURLs](https://github.com/ClearURLs)

The documentation for that project can be found [here](https://docs.clearurls.xyz/1.23.0/)

A privacy focused messenger should have something like this as to remove any sort of tracking data for its users. 

Thanks.
